# Spotify-Dataset-Compiler

The script compiles all the songs in the four most recent playlists.
It reads a sheet of compiled usernames and iterates through each user.

The sample out includes Pivot tables of data to analyze.
The first sheet gives decriptions of each page. 
Raw data is the actual output of script.


Work in Progress:
- Turn into function: add parameters for excel sheet of usernames and for number of playlists
- Add time restraints to eliminate request bans
